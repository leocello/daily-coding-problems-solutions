# Problem #35 [Hard]  

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.  

This problem was asked by Google.  

Given an array of strictly the characters `'R'`, `'G'`, and `'B'`, segregate the values of the array so that all the `R`s come first, the `G`s come second, and the `B`s come last. You can only swap elements of the array.  

Do this in linear time and in-place.  

For example, given the array `['G', 'B', 'R', 'R', 'B', 'R', 'G']`, it should become `['R', 'R', 'R', 'G', 'G', 'B', 'B']`.
