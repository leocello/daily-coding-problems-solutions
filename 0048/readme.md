# Problem #48 [Medium]  

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.  

This problem was asked by Google.  

Given pre-order and in-order traversals of a binary tree, write a function to reconstruct the tree.  

For example, given the following preorder traversal:  

```javascript
[a, b, d, e, c, f, g]
```

And the following inorder traversal:  

```javascript
[d, b, e, a, f, c, g]
```

You should return the following tree:  

```text
    a
   / \
  b   c
 / \ / \
d  e f  g
```
